# UDP-Protocol
  
## Description of the problem
In this project the HTTP client & HTTP server (remove file manager) of previous projects (Add link to the other projects) was implemented using UDP protocol. In the previous project TCP protocol was implemented to guarantee packet transmission over unreliable network links. In this project to make UDP protocol reliable to guarantee packet transmission, the Automatic-Repeat-Request Protocol known as Selective Repeat ARC / Selective Reject ARQ was used.
