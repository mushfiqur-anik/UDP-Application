# UDP
  
## Description of the problem
In this assignment, you will re-implement the HTTP client and the HTTP remote file manager of Assignments #1 and #2 respectively using UDP protocol. In the previous assignments, you leverage TCP protocol for implementation to guarantee packet transmission over unreliable network links. Because you are going to use UDP protocol that does not guarantee the transfer, you need to insure reliability by implementing a specific instance of the Automatic-Repeat-Request (ARQ) protocol called: Selective Repeat ARQ / Selective Reject ARQ. Before starting on this Lab, we encourage you to review the programming samples and the associated course materials.
